# Scene Forge

Progressive Web Application for 3D scenes handling

## Description

Scene Forge is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that allows users to
create, visualise and manipulate 3D objects in a 3D space. The application
includes some features, such as:

 - Add 3D hotspots with custom text and links;
 - Export the scene as a JSON file with the possibility of embedding it in
   other web pages;
 - Export the scene to a series of images to create a 3D animation.

The application is offline capable, which means it does not depend on a request
to a backend service to enable any given feature/capability.

## Development

- [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
