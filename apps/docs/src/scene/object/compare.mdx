# `compare` Function

The `compare` function is a utility function that compares two `Scene` nodes
objects and returns one the values `-1`, `0` or `1` based on the comparison
result.

## Parameters

- `a` - The first `Scene` node object to compare.
- `b` - The second `Scene` node object to compare.

The `Scene` node could be any object, it does not have to implement any type
of the Babylon.js Scene object types.

## Usage

```typescript
import { Mesh, Camera } from "@babylonjs/core";
import { compare } from '@sceneforge/scene';

const a = new Camera("a");
const b = new Mesh("b");
const c = new Mesh("c");

c.setParent(b, true, true);

const nodeArray = [a, b];

nodeArray.sort(compare);
// returns: [b, a]
```

The reason why `b` comes before `a` is because `b` has a child node `c` and
`a` does not have any child nodes.

The logic behind the comparison is that if nodes with children come before
nodes without children, and then, it compares the nodes based on the name.
