## Overview

For the 3D rendering on Web, the core setup starts with the `Engine`.
For Babylon.js, the `Engine` is the main class that handles the rendering loop
into the HTML Canvas element.

Some configuration options are available to customise the rendering look, and
in order to improve the performance, the initilisation of the `Engine` should
also be considered, as it can be a heavy operation.

## Engine Controller

The `EngineController` is a class that wraps the Babylon.js Engine instance.
It provides a set of methods to control the rendering loop and the basic Scene
setup with a camera and a light.

### Usage

```typescript
import { EngineController } from '@sceneforge/scene';

const canvas = document.getElementById('renderCanvas') as HTMLCanvasElement;

const controller = new EngineController(canvas, true);

controller.start();
```

The `EngineController` constructor takes two arguments:
- `canvas`: the HTML Canvas element to render the scene
- `commonNodes` (optional): a flag to enable the common nodes setup (camera
  and light)

The `start` method is used to start the rendering loop.

### Attributes

- `canvas`: the HTML Canvas element
- `engine`: the Babylon.js Engine instance
- `scene`: the Babylon.js Scene instance
- `camera`: the Babylon.js Camera instance
- `light`: the Babylon.js Light instance
- `state`: the current [Engine State](?path=/docs/sceneforge-scene-types-enginestate--documentation)
  of the rendering loop

### Methods

- `start()`: start the rendering loop
- `stop()`: stop the rendering loop and dispose the Babylon.js Scene and
  Engine instances
- `pause()`: pause the rendering loop
